    def on(self) -> bool: return True
    def overload(self) -> int: return 0

```python
box = BoxClass() #create a box instance
box.serve(303) #serve the box at a port
```

### How to connect to a box

```python
#Use Box.seek for a collection of IPs (fastest way)
available = Box.seek(('XXX.XXX.XXX','XXX.XXX.XXX'), (303,304))

#Look through all the network for available boxes at some port
available = Box.network(303)
